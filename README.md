## More about my christmas shop - A Local JSON API Shop Course Project

This is a fictional online storefront built as a final project for a web development course.  
The site is implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, based on a custom design created in Figma.

Users can browse products, view product details (with image and video), and interact with a simulated shopping cart powered by a simple local JavaScript API.

The project includes:

- Custom-made graphics, product images, and promotional video
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- A working shopping cart with product summary and checkout views
- Local JSON data for products and cart handling
- JavaScript functionality for adding items, calculating totals, and rendering the basket
- Modern image formats (e.g., WebP) and performance-optimized media
- A clear design system with fonts, colors, icons, and layout guidelines

This app is deployed on a public web host and intended for demonstration and learning purposes only.
